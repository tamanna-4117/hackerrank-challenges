# For Loop

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

A _for_ loop is a programming language statement which allows code to be repeatedly executed.  

The syntax is

	for ( <expression_1> ; <expression_2> ; <expression_3> )
    	<statement>

- _expression\_1_ is used for intializing variables which are generally used for controlling the terminating flag for the loop.
- _expression\_2_ is used to check for the terminating condition. If this evaluates to false, then the loop is terminated.
- _expression\_3_ is generally used to update the flags/variables.

A sample loop is

	for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    	...
    }
    
In this challenge, you will use a for loop to increment a variable through a range.  

**Input Format**

You will be given two positive integers, $a$ and $b$ ($a \le b$), separated by a newline.

**Constraints**

 

**Output Format**

For each integer $n$ in the inclusive interval $[a, b]$:

- If $1 \le n \le 9$, then print the English representation of it in lowercase. That is "one" for $1$, "two" for $2$, and so on.
- Else if $n > 9$ and it is an even number, then print "even".
- Else if $n > 9$ and it is an odd number, then print "odd".

**Note:** $[a, b] = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} \,|\, ~a \le x \le b\} = \{a, ~a+1, \dots, b\}$

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Complete the code.
    
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;
    
    const string word[] = {"", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine"};
    for( int i=a; i<=b; i++ )
    {
    if( i>=1 && i<=9 ){
        cout << word[i] << endl;
    }
    else if(i>9 && i%2==0){
        cout << "even" << endl;
    } 
    else{
        cout << "odd" <<endl;
    }
    } 
    return 0;
}

```
